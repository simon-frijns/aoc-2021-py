## Part 1

### Approach

Python 3.10 match/case.

### Thoughts

Wonder whether there's a better way than amount = int(amount).

## Part 2

### Approach

Exact same approach as above.

### Thoughts

Not entirely happy that the problem rephrases depth as aim - leads to me doing some ugly stuff after generalising.
